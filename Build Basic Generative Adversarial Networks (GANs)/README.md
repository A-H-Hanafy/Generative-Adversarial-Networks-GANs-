# Build Basic Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)

In this course, you will:
- Learn about GANs and their applications
- Understand the intuition behind the fundamental components of GANs
- Explore and implement multiple GAN architectures
- Build conditional GANs capable of generating examples from determined categories

I will update the assignment notebook with solution every period
